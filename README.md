# iPiDA-LGE: A Local and Global Graph Ensemble Learning Framework for Identifying PiRNA-Disease Associations

This repository contains the source code used in our paper titled iPiDA-LGE: A Local and Global Graph Ensemble Learning Framework for Identifying PiRNA-Disease Associations. The code is implemented to realize the proposed predictor, and the dataset and tutorials are also provided to assist users in utilizing the code.

# Introduction
In this study, we propose a novel computational method named iPiDA-LGE for identifying piRNA-disease associations. iPiDA-LGE comprises two graph convolutional neural network modules based on local and global piRNA-disease graphs, aimed at capturing specific and general features of piRNA-disease pairs. Additionally, it integrates their refined and macroscopic inferences to derive the final prediction result. The experimental results show that iPiDA-LGE effectively leverages the advantages of both local and global graph learning, thereby achieving stronger pair representation and superior prediction performance.
